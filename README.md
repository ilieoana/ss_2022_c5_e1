## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

This project was implemented as part of my learning journey with Spring Security. I followed the tutorial closely and:

- Recreated the project from scratch in my local environment.
- Applied authorization at endpoint level to the filter chain.
- Created in memory users.
- Understood difference between authority and role, and applied authorization rules with methods like `hasAuthority()`
  or `hasRole()`.
- Added matcher methods to apply the authority rules to specific path mappings.
- Understood the difference between 401 Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden Http codes.
